## Abstract

Smart mobile devices has been widely used in modern society. Its convenience enhance the efficiency of the work as well as bring a new life to people. In order to provide a more secured environment, the OS providers introduced screen lock software that is build on top of OS. Despite the improved feature they added on the mobile devices, its high frequency of asking user to log in every time he/she wake up the phone still bring inconvenience for the user. This article wants to implement a machine learning model to minimize the times a user have to log in under true positive surrounding safety check. We tried to use supervised machine algorithm with two different algorithm to build a model of user based on his/her sersor data, including the current time, accelerate, latitude, longitude, altitude, speed, wifi info and bluetooth info. By using this feature, we got a 97.5% successful rate under a known safe area and a 80% successful rate under a known dangerous area.
